Jonathan Jasper Jeremy Jones<br>
was a busy young fellow without any bones.<br>
He was born one day in an apple tree<br>
And thought the world was what he could see.<p>

“My this world is a beautiful green<br>
And good to eat, that’s plain to be seen.<br>
He ate and ate so he could grow. <br>
He ate the leaves of his house, and so...<p>

When he lifted his headed and looked around<br>
He was delighted to see the ground.<br>
"The world is bigger than just this tree.<br>
I really must go down and see."<p>

So Jonathan Jasper Jeremy Jones<br>
A curious young fellow without any bones<br>
Went humping and bumping and inching along.<br>
His idea was good but his path was wrong.<p>

For while he was humping along a limb,<br>
Danger was waiting to strike at him. <br>
A hungry robin with beady eye,<br>
Saw fat, fuzzy Jonathan creeping by.<p>

The robin swooped into the tree<br>
And Jonathan gasped “It’s the end for me.<br>
But just as the robin’s beak came around<br>
Jonathan let go and dropped to the ground.<p> 

He hid in the grass for part of the day<br>
Until it seemed safe to crawl away.<br>
"This world is so big and I'm so small<br>
I'm afraid I don’t count for much at all."<p>

Jonathan Jasper Jeremy Jones<br>
A determined young fellow without any bones<br>
Pulled himself up to the top of a stone,<br>
Hoping that he would be left alone. <p>

But down in the grass where Jon couldn't see<br>
A snake was thinking, "There's lunch for me."<br>
He slithered along and was coming quite near<br>
When Jonathan noticed and shook with fear.<p>


The snake was getting ready to bite<br>
When Jonathan twisted with all his might.<br> 
The snake struck but his fangs went wide <br>
As Jonathan Jasper rolled to the side. <p>

Jonathan Jasper Jeremy Jones,<br>
That frightened young fellow without any bones,<br>
Went humping and bumping through fields of grass,<br>
Till he came to a road that looked hard to pass.<p> 	

Tractors and trucks were zooming through<br>
And Jonathan hardly knew what to do.<br>
Till one of them sopped and started to spray<br>
The very tree he had left that day<p>

Lucky for him he went to explore,<br>
Since that tree wasn’t healthy for him anymore<br>
And now he knew he must keep going<br>
Even though the traffic was flowing.<p>

Jonahan Jasper Jeremy Jones<br>
That lucky young fellow without any bones<br>
Scurried and scampered, and scooted and tried<br>
To move safely across to the other side<p>

It took so long for him to crawl,<br>
Could he ever get through this world at all?<br>
He thought about wings, he thought about speed.<br>
"Wings, now that's what I really need."<p>

Then Jonathan Jasper Jeremy Jones,<br>
That weary young fellow without any bones,<br>
Said "I'm getting so tired I need to rest.<br>
I'll look for a place to build a nest."<p>

He fastened his silk to a branch off the ground<br>
And wrapped himself around and around.<br>
He went to sleep the whole winter through,<br>
And while he slept his wish came true. <p>

Slowly within his tiny space<br>
A wonderful change was taking place.<br>
And one spring day in the warming sun<br>
Jon woke up with work to be done. <p>

"I must be up and on my way.<br>
I can't lie around this cocoon all day."<br>
So he wiggled his way into the air<br>
And rested awhile, just hanging there.<p>

And when his eyes had opened wide,<br>
A most beautiful thing was by his side.<br>
It was a butterfly, bold and free,<br>
Who said, "Jonathan, come fly with me."<p>

"Why I can only hump and crawl.<br>
I never could do that at all."<br>
"Jon, you're not a caterpillar anymore.<br>
Look at your wings, you're ready to soar."<p>

So Jonathan Jasper Jeremy Jones,<br>
An astonished young fellow without any bones,<br>
Looked at his wings in sheer delight</br>
And rose on the air in perfect flight</p>
