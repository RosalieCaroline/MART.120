<p class="content">Jonathan Jasper Jeremy Jones </p>
<p class="content">was a busy young fellow without any bones.</p>
<p class="content">He was born one day in an apple tree</p>
<p class="content">And thought the world was what he could see.</p>

<br></br>

<p class="content">“My this world is a beautiful green</p>
<p class="content">And good to eat, that’s plain to be seen.</p>
<p class="content">He ate and ate so he could grow. </p>
<p class="content">He ate the leaves of his house, and so...</p>

<br></br>

<p class="content">When he lifted his headed and looked around</p>
<p class="content">He was delighted to see the ground.</p>
<p class="content">"The world is bigger than just this tree.</p>
<p class="content">I really must go down and see."</p>

<br></br>

<p class="content">So Jonathan Jasper Jeremy Jones</p>
<p class="content">A curious young fellow without any bones</p>
<p class="content">Went humping and bumping and inching along.</p>
<p class="content">His idea was good but his path was wrong.</p>

<br></br>

<p class="content">For while he was humping along a limb,</p>
<p class="content">Danger was waiting to strike at him. </p>
<p class="content">A hungry robin with beady eye,</p>
<p class="content">Saw fat, fuzzy Jonathan creeping by.</p>

<br></br>

<p class="content">The robin swooped into the tree</p>
<p class="content">And Jonathan gasped “It’s the end for me.</p>
<p class="content">But just as the robin’s beak came around</p>
<p class="content">Jonathan let go and dropped to the ground.</p> 

<br></br>

<p class="content">He hid in the grass for part of the day</p>
<p class="content">Until it seemed safe to crawl away.</p>
<p class="content">"This world is so big and I'm so small</p>
<p class="content">I'm afraid I don’t count for much at all."</p>

<br></br>

<p class="content">Jonathan Jasper Jeremy Jones</p>
<p class="content">A determined young fellow without any bones</p>
<p class="content">Pulled himself up to the top of a stone,</p>
<p class="content">Hoping that he would be left alone.</p>

<br></br>

<p class="content">But down in the grass where Jon couldn't see</p>
<p class="content">A snake was thinking, "There's lunch for me."</p>
<p class="content">He slithered along and was coming quite near</p>
<p class="content">When Jonathan noticed and shook with fear.</p>

<br></br>

<p class="content">The snake was getting ready to bite</p>
<p class="content">When Jonathan twisted with all his might.</p> 
<p class="content">The snake struck but his fangs went wide </p>
<p class="content">As Jonathan Jasper rolled to the side.</p>

<br></br>

<p class="content">Jonathan Jasper Jeremy Jones,</p>
<p class="content">That frightened young fellow without any bones,</p>
<p class="content">Went humping and bumping through fields of grass,</p>
<p class="content">Till he came to a road that looked hard to pass.</p> 	

<br></br>

<p class="content">Tractors and trucks were zooming through</p>
<p class="content">And Jonathan hardly knew what to do.</p>
<p class="content">Till one of them stopped and started to spray</p>
<p class="content">The very tree he had left that day</p>

<br></br>

<p class="content">Lucky for him he went to explore,</p>
<p class="content">Since that tree wasn’t healthy for him anymore</p>
<p class="content">And now he knew he must keep going</p>
<p class="content">Even though the traffic was flowing.</p>

<br></br>

<p class="content">Jonahan Jasper Jeremy Jones</p>
<p class="content">That lucky young fellow without any bones</p>
<p class="content">Scurried and scampered, and scooted and tried</p>
<p class="content">To move safely across to the other side</p>

<br></br>

<p class="content">It took so long for him to crawl,</p>
<p class="content">Could he ever get through this world at all?</p>
<p class="content">He thought about wings, he thought about speed.</p>
<p class="content">"Wings, now that's what I really need."</p>

<br></br>

<p class="content">Then Jonathan Jasper Jeremy Jones,</p>
<p class="content">That weary young fellow without any bones,</p>
<p class="content">Said "I'm getting so tired I need to rest.</p>
<p class="content">I'll look for a place to build a nest."</p>

<br></br>

<p class="content">He fastened his silk to a branch off the ground</p>
<p class="content">And wrapped himself around and around.</p>
<p class="content">He went to sleep the whole winter through,</p>
<p class="content">And while he slept his wish came true.</p>

<br></br>

<p class="content">Slowly within his tiny space</p>
<p class="content">A wonderful change was taking place.</p>
<p class="content">And one spring day in the warming sun</p>
<p class="content">Jon woke up with work to be done. </p>

<br></br>

<p class="content">"I must be up and on my way.</p>
<p class="content">I can't lie around this cocoon all day."</p>
<p class="content">So he wiggled his way into the air</p>
<p class="content">And rested awhile, just hanging there.</p>

<br></br>

<p class="content">And when his eyes had opened wide,</p>
<p class="content">A most beautiful thing was by his side.</p>
<p class="content">It was a butterfly, bold and free,</p>
<p class="content">Who said, "Jonathan, come fly with me."</p>

<br></br>

<p class="content">"Why I can only hump and crawl.</p>
<p class="content">I never could do that at all."</p>
<p class="content">"Jon, you're not a caterpillar anymore.</p>
<p class="content">Look at your wings, you're ready to soar."</p>

<br></br>

<p class="content">So Jonathan Jasper Jeremy Jones,</p>
<p class="content">An astonished young fellow without any bones,</p>
<p class="content">Looked at his wings in sheer delight</p>
<p class="content">And rose on the air in perfect flight</p>
