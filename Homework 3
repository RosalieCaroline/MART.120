Last Lecture Paper
	I found The Last Lecture to be extremely moving. Not only was it good story telling, but the message(s) was profound. Randy Pausch’s perspective on the necessity of obstacles it similar to the concept of grit. It’s easy to dream about a goal, but you have to really want it in order to achieve it, and obstacles are a great way of testing that. This resonates with me because I’ve had several goals I wanted, but the obstacles proved to be too great and taught me that I only wanted the idea of the goal, not the goal itself. Randy Pausch touches on that idea when he talks about his goal of being in the NFL, but he “got more from not achieving this goal than if he had achieved it.” I believe learning what we don’t want to do is just as important as knowing what we want to do. There’s so much to discover in this world, and I agree with Randy Pausch that we must have a childlike wonder and to have fun with it. The part that stuck with me the most was his “headfake” that this lecture was for his kids. What a beautiful way to leave a message for your kids.
